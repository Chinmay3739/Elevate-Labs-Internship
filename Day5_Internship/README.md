In this Task we Perform full netwokr scan using Wiresark and analyze all the protocols and packets in it.
The files DNS_filtered.pcapng,
          TLS_Filtered.pcapng,
          TCP_Filtered.pcapng,
          ICMP_filtered.pcapng are all prefiltered files created for the specific protocols to study 
          them individually.
All files are filtered from Wireshark_example.pcapng which contains full packet capture unfiltered.
